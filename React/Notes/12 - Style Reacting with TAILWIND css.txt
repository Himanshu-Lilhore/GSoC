For installing Tailwind in your project, go to Tailwind's website, and for Vite (if your local project is built using Vite), go through installation instructions for Vite first.

And as the setup for tailwind is done, you can start using it as usual, add the tailwind class names to the className prop of the elements/components and see the magic.
